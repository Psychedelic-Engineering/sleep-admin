#Sleep-Machine
===========

Sleep-Machine aims to be a physical device, the associated software and some online-services for the administration of the sleeping process -
covering all the phases and transitions of sleep like falling asleep, deep-sleep, dreaming and waking up.


It started as the idea of creating my own customized alarm clock because all my life i had problems waking up (and falling asleep).
Soon i realized that this requires a holistic approach, covering the complete sleep cycle instead of focussing on wake-up.


Pragmatic & unscientific
explorative

Analyze & track my sleep
