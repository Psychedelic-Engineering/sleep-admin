#Sleep-Machine
===========

Sleep-Machine aims to be a physical device, its associated software and some online-services for the administration of the sleeping process -
covering all the variations, phases and transitions of sleep like falling asleep, taking a nap, dreaming and waking up.

It started as the idea of creating my own customized alarm clock because all my life i had problems waking up (and falling asleep).
Soon i realized that this requires a holistic approach, covering the complete sleep cycle instead of focussing on wake-up.

My approach is rather experimental, pragmatic and playfull than scientific.

The first incarnation consists of:

A basestation next to the bed (like an conventional alarm clock) with
a touch-screen display
some strong leds for wake-up lighing (200 watt, cold and warm)
a PIR motion sensor
a RaspberryPi

A pillow with
acceleration and touch sensors
a pair of speakers
some vibration motors

a third component will be a Raspberry Airplay client with
USB-Audio
Relais for switching on the hifi-system
