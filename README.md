#Sleep-Machine
===========

Sleep-Machine aims to be a physical device, its associated software and some online-services for the administration of the sleeping process -
covering all the variations, phases and transitions of sleep like falling asleep, taking a nap, dreaming and waking up.


It started as the idea of creating my own customized alarm clock because all my life i had problems waking up (and falling asleep).
Soon i realized that this requires a holistic approach, covering the complete sleep cycle instead of focussing on wake-up.

My approach is rather experimental, pragmatic and playfull than scientific.

The first incarnation consists of:

A pillow with sensors, a pair of speakers and vibration motors and a base station with a display, some strong leds (warm and cold white, later RGB) for wake-up lighing.

Pragmatic & unscientific
explorative

Analyze & track my sleep
