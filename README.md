sleep-admin
===========

Sleep-Admin aims to be a physical device, software and some online-services for the administration of the sleeping process -
covering all the phases of sleep like falling asleep, deep-sleep, dreaming and waking up.</br>
It started as the idea of creating my own alarm clock because i always have problems waking up.
Soon i realized that this requires a holistic approach, covering the complete sleep cycle.
